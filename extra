div

[DISPLAY]
--->
block elements- which usually take up the whole line 
        *div
        *p
        *h1-h6
        *lists
        *forms

--->
inline elements- only take space that is needed
       *span
       *img
       *a
difference is in inline we cannot change the width while in block we can change but still the next element appears on the next line only.

we change the display property of block elements to inline(but loses change in width option) and vice-versa

--->
****but to get the property of both .....
      display: inline-block;

--->
display: none;
hides the element as it was not even there
....
but visibility: hidden;
hides it and keeps its place safe.
